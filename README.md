# Fake-News-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
Fake News Detection is a machine learning-based system that identifies misleading or false news articles by analyzing their content. This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess text and classify news as real or fake.

## **Introduction**

In todayâ€™s fast-paced digital world, spreading fake news has become a significant concern. With the increasing ease of access to social media platforms and other online sources of information, it has become more challenging to distinguish between real and fake news. In this project-based article, we will learn how to build a machine-learning model to detect fake news accurately.

The steps we will follow in this project are:

Data collection and exploration
Text preprocessing
Feature extraction
Model training and evaluation
Deployment
